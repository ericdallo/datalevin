# Datalevin Query Engine

## Motivation

Currently, Datalevin mostly inherits Datascript query engine, which is inefficient, as it
does things the following way: all the data that matches each *individual* triple
pattern clause are fetched and turned into a set of datoms. The sets of datoms
matching each clause are then hash-joined together one set after another. So if
a query has _n_ clauses, it would do _n_ index scans and _n-1_ hash joins.

Even with user hand crafted clauses order, this process still performs a lot of
unnecessary data fetching and transformation, joins a lot of unneeded tuples and
materializes a lot of intermediate relations needlessly. Although Datalevin
added a few simple query optimizations, it is far from solving the problems.

To address these problems, we will develop a new query engine that attempts to evaluate the
query with minimal cost. We will also support an `explain` option for the users to see the query
execution steps.

This query engine will leverage some unique properties of EAV stores,
take advantage of some new indexing structures, utilizing the state of the art join
algorithms, employs a new query execution style and do concurrent query execution.

## Difference from RDF Stores

Although EAV stores are heavily inspired by RDF stores, there are some important
differences that impacts the query engine design.

In RDF stores, there's no explicit identification of entities, and a Subject vs.
Object join is implicit by value unification, whereas in EAV stores, these are
explicit.  First, the entities are explicitly defined during transactions in EAV
stores; second, the entity vs. entity relationship is also explicitly marked by
`:db.type/ref` value type. Concequently, unlike in RDF stores, expensive
algorithms to discover entities and their relationship become unnecessary. We
will exploit these for indexing.

On the other hand, RDF stores often have a very limited number of properties
even for huge datasets, whereas EAV stores can have many more attributes as
attributes are often specialized, e.g. to encode the entity information in the
namespaces of the attributes. Grouping of attributes should have greater benefits.

## New Indices

Based on these observations, we introduce two new type of indices.

### Entity classes

First we introduce a concept of entity class, which refers to the type of
entities. Similar to characteristic sets [8] in RDF stores or tables in
relational DB,  this concept captures the defining combination of attributes for
a class of entities.

In EAV stores, the set of attributes for a class of entities are often unique.
There might be overlapping attributes between entity classes, but many
attributes are used by only one class of entities, and these are often prefixed
by the namespace unique to that entity class. We assign auto increment integer
id for each entity class, and represent the mapping from attributes to entity
class with bitmaps.

Specifically, each attribute schema entry has a `:db/classes` key pointing to a
set of entity class ids that include the attribute in their definitions. This
way, we can quickly identify the entity classes relevant to a query or a
transaction through fast set intersections.

An additional "classes" LMDB DBI will be used, the keys will be class ids, and
the values are the corresponding entities represented by a bitmap of
entity ids. This allows us to quickly find relevant entities for a query.

Unlike previous work in the literature, our definition of entity class is firm
(i.e. one class is defined by one unique set of attributes), but the class
membership is flexible.  As attributes are added to or removed from an entity
during its lifetime in the database, the entity may find itself belonging to
multiple related entity classes. We made this choice because the cost of always
maintaining accurate entity class membership for all entities is rather high,
for we had to maintain a mapping from entity to its class. We accept the slight
overhead of matching more entities than necessary during query. Since the
purpose of entity class is only to pre-filter entities, not to precisely match
query constraints, some false positives are acceptable, as long as there is no
false negative. In this sense, entity class works like a free bloom filter
without doing any hashing.

For common attributes that should not contribute to the defintion of entity
classes, user can mark such attributes under `:common-attributes` key, as part
of of the option map given when openning the DB.

### Class links

We further introduce a notion of entity class link that represents a pair of entity
classes that are connected by triples with `:db.type/ref` type attributes.
Similar to extended characteristic sets [7] or foreign key relation in
relational DB, this concept captures the long range relationship in the EAV
data. We will leverage such declaration to infer the links between entity
classes in the data, and store the resulting graph.

Specifically, a "links" LMDB DBI will be used, the keys are the pair of the
entity class ids of the referring entity class (class of E) and the referred
entity class (class of V), the values are bitmaps of entity ids of
referred entities (V), so that we can look up the linking triples quickly in VAE
DBI, which contains linking triples only.

In addition, the schema map has a built-in key `:db/graph`, and its value stores
the adjacency list of the class link graph of the data, i.e. a map of links to
the set of their adjacent links. This graph structure capture the overall structure
of the data. We will use this to pre-filter entities for those complex
queries spanning multiple related entity classes.

The unique properties of EAV stores allows us to build the entity
classes and links described above incrementally during data transactions, instead of
having to build them using expensive algorithms to go through full data set.

## Optimizations

The query engine will employs multiple optimizations.

### Filter with links and classes

Our engine will first leverage the entity classes and the links between them
to generate the skeleton of the execution plan.  Essentially, we leverage the set of attributes
and their relationships in the query to:

    a. break up the query into sub-queries that can be independently executed,

    b. pre-filter the entities involved in each sub-query.

This pre-filtering significantly reduces the amount of work we have to do, especially for
complex queries that involves long chains of where clauses.

As we can see, the planner first consider long range relationships.  The reason to avoid
starting with local star-like relationships is because they are often
unselective, due to high correlation between attributes of an entity class.

Entity classes and links form a directed graph. Querying is effectively matching
query graph with the stored data graph.  After the engine identifies the entity classes as
well as their linkage in the query, query link graph is then matched to data
link graph, producing a set of link chains.

Each chain can be considered a sub-query, and sub-queries can be processed
by different thread in parallel, so large query can be performed more quickly on a multi-core system.
The results of the sub-queries are then joined together.

For joins within a sub-query, we start with clause with least cardinality.
"classes" and "links" based index scans will also participate in this search for
least cardinality calculation as if they are normal pattern clauses, as they may not be
the cheapest.  This addresses the limitation of [7], which does not have other indices.

### Pivot scan

For large number of local star-like attributes, the engine will also consider
pivot scan [2] that returns multiple attribute values in a single index scan,
because after the most selective attributes have been joined together to reach a
low enough tuple count, it might be cheaper to obtain remaining attributes with
a pivot scan than match-and-join them.

### Predicates push-down

In RDF stores, all the triple values are normally considered nominal literals, and hence
encoded as integer IDs, whereas in EAV stores, like in relational databases, the
values often should be considered ordinal (i.e. as numerical data), hence it is
beneficial to store them as they are and sort them by value. It is important to push down
predicates on values into indexing access methods in order to take advantage of
this kind of storage to minimize unnecessary intermediate results.

### Join methods selection

Traditional planner is based on pair wise joins of two relations, one join at a
time. Different join methods are suitable for different situations: When the
tuples on both sides are sorted on the join attribute,  merge join performs the
best.  It should be used as much as possible when the condition meets. Nested
loop join works well when tuple counts are small.  Hash join can be used when
neither cases are suitable.

Recently, worst-case optimal multi-way join algorithms are proposed [1] and have
been implemented in some commercial DBs [10]. Such join algorithms
has also begun to be tried in RDF cases [4]. In essence, these multi-way algorithms do nested
joins one tuple at a time to avoid materializing data that would not be in
the results. Though optimal for the worst-case, they may not perform better in
practice, e.g. when joins are selective. They are good at dealing with cases of
growing intermediate results [3] for join variables (but not lonely variables).
So the engine collapses multiple pair-wise joins into one multi-way join when it estimates that
the cardinality of intermediate results will be greater than that of the largest of the
participating relations, e.g. as often the case in those involving value-value joins.

## A* Search Style Query Evaluation

As a major break from the traditional Selinger style query planners [9], where dynamic programming
based query planning is done ahead of query execution, our query engine works more
like an A* search algorithm, where planning and execution happen in tandem. The main
reason is to be able to obtain more accurate cost estimation during query execution, rather
than relying on purely speculative ahead of time estimation. In the
exploration phase of A* search algorithm, where we need to determine the next
join step, we can leverage sampling [6] to get better estimation, since the
prior joins already produced results and one side of relation is known.

Some data statistics is still needed for estimating cost of operations. Some can
be updated during transaction, e.g. effectively collected when we build the
various bitmaps described above, as these bitmaps can easily return the distinct
counts and other statistics. Others are collected at query time, e.g. range scan
count and filter predicate count, since these are relatively cheap to query.
Some optimization can also be used, e.g. when the goal is to find the least
count among several options, counting with a cap can be used to stop counting
after the known minimum is reached.

It is well-known that most cardinality estimation methods under-estimate the cost [5] due
to independence assumption, etc. Fortunately, this under-estimation of cost plays
right into the admissible requirement of A* search algorithm, as long as we
never over-estimate the cost of the remaining joins, we likely obtain an optimal
join path.

As to data structure used in joins, instead of returning a list of full datoms, the query index access functions
return a list of bound values of variables instead. This avoid repetitively
deserializing known components of a triple pattern, and then having to ignore them
during joins. Such results are also consistent with the results of bitmap operations on
"classes" and "links" indices, i.e. they return a list of sorted entity ids.
Accordingly, nested hashmap will be used to collect intermediate results, where
each level corresponds to a variable.
